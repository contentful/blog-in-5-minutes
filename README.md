## Getting started

To really get you started from end to end please check out [the getting started guide](./docs/GETTING-STARTED.md).

## Technical stack

This project is based on [nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/).

### Why nuxt.js?

nuxt.js is based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Vue is a fairly new JS framework that provides excellent documentation and is a pleasure to work with. nuxt.js sits on top of Vue and was choosen because of two main feature:

- dynamic rendering on the server running in Node.js
- static file generation

These two features make it very flexible and extensible to make your blog run anywhere.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).

### What is used for styling?

To keep the work effort low (and there a million ways to write CSS) the [Foundation CSS framework is included](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/css.html). There is no further thinking behind this decision except to make this example "kind of" pretty. :)
